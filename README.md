# F1-2022-Suzuka-Qualifying-Analysis

**Leclerc was 0.01 seconds away from snatching pole from Verstappen!** 

The Japanese Grand Prix never fails to bring us some excitement and some moments where you just can't stay still on your sofa watching it. As for today, Verstappen has gotten the pole, which places him on the front row sitting alongside Leclerc, who missed out on the pole by just 10 miliseconds. On the final lap of Q3, everyone was thinking that Ferrari was able to get a front row lockout since both of the drivers were up by a couple of tenths at the end of the second sector. Verstappen was definitely losing pole since he went wide through turn 1 and 2 of the infamous Suzuka track. But then both of the Ferrari drivers lost lots of time through the last sector, which caused Verstappen to get pole by 0.01 seconds, with Sainz on the third grid just half a tenth of a second shy of Verstappen.

This visualisation below shows the analysis between Verstappen and Leclerc's qualifying lap.
